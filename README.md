# Tumor brain CNN
A jupyter example of a CNN model to predict and classify tumor brain according to X-Rays images.
Developed on **Kaggle** notebook with CPU.

Below the steps done:

- shown how to treat images in Python and how to prepare them for feeding AI models;
- how to augment data where you don't have enough samples like in this case;
- how to build a Convolutional neural network from scratch.
- analyze and show results with metrics


#### TODO: in a future could be interesting acquire more images to improve the performance of the algorithm
